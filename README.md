# An experimental interactive collaborative platform of geospatial content - collaborative learning, aviation weather & flight planning
An experimental interactive collaborative platform of geospatial content including flight planning with realtime nowcast and forecast weather along the route and global/local aviation weather on fast, stable and highly available @mapbox map on a clean UI. weather datas along the routes powered by openweathermap. METAR and TAF by NOAA. world magnetic model coefficient 2025-2029 by NOAA. weather datas like wind, precipitation, temp, pressure, cloud covering, humidity, etc. by NOAA and openweahtermap. weather visualization powered by gdal tools. terrain elevation datas by cgiar consortium spatial information. development and design ©2022 by gerd tunay schuster

### features

- Plan your flight routes with realtime nowcast and forecast (48 hours) global aviation weather along the route.
- Various global meteorological layers like temperature, humidity, dew point, atmospheric pressure and density on MSL, wind and gusts, cloud covering and precipitation.
- Practice in the platform specifically designed for learning the basics of instrument navigation. The RMI (Radio Magnetic Indicator) tool was designed to demonstrate the approximate indication that an RMI would display with varying positions of an aircraft in relation to certain navigational facilities.
- app.tunay.io is a collaborative learning platform that allows pupils to make the learning experience engaging, collaborative, and interactive. a group of pupils joins together at app.tunay.io to improve there skills in radiotelephony and the safety in aviation. once logged into the app, the student can position their virtual aircraft on the map using a compass rose. everyone can see everyone. this method provides additional visual support for any verbal radio course.

> __Warning__ Please be informed that the flight planning with this application is for rough orientation only and may not be used for real flights. Use at your own risk. Please confirm all weather datas at the original source. These are for internal information only and may be wrong, out of date, or incomplete. app.tunay.io assumes no liability for the correctness, accuracy, relevance, reliability or completeness of the information published.

The maps are based on mercator and orthographic (globe) map projection. Projection is referred to as EPSG:900913 or EPSG:3857 – ellipsoid WGS84. Mercator is a conformal cylindrical map projection that was originally created to display accurate compass bearings for sea/air travel. An additional feature of this projection is that all local shapes are accurate and correctly defined at infinitesimal scale. The geometric characterization of cylindrical projections just presented leads to an algebraic form that a cylindrical projection must have. Specifically, a cylindrical projection must have the form T (φ, θ) = (θ, h(φ)). Mercator: T (φ, θ) = (θ, ln(|sec(φ) + tan(φ)|)). It was presented by Gerardus Mercator in 1569. The orthographic projection (globe) is an azimuthal perspective projection, projecting the earths surface from an infinite distance to a plane. The globe is naturally parameterized in terms of two variables, latitude φ and longitude θ. Thus, we could think of a map projection as a function T : R2 to R2 or T(φ,θ) = (x(φ,θ),y(φ,θ))
